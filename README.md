# LaMetricHiveOS
A NodeJS App that retrieves info from the Hive OS API and returns it in a format readable by LaMetric Time digital clocks.

This app runs in a Heroku dyno and is accessed by the 'HiveOS ETH Hashrate' app in the LaMetric Marketplace.  The LaMetric Time is a small digital clock with an LED display that can be used to display a variety of information.  There are probably better ways to display the ETH hashrate of your rig but I happened to have one of these clocks lying around doing nothing.  

In the future I might add a custom icon instead of the pre-existing 'ETH' one I am using now.  I could also expand upon the app to show other metrics such as GPU temperatures and pending balance.
